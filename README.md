## **List of Improvements**

**Home Page**

- Decreased the size of the banner on the home page, so it does not take up the whole screen
- Removed the donate button from the top, as there is a whole page dedicated to donations, and the button's appearance was not appealing
- Moved important information to the top like who the organization is and what they are about
- Made the values section look nicer and added icons to represent each one
- Created a new recent news & events section to group relevant information

**Our Board**

- Make an appealing grid layout of board members that includes their names as well as a picture which did not exist before.

**Impact Page**

- Made the mission statement “pop” more
- Listed goals and strategies in a more appealing way and added check boxes instead of bullets
- Shrunk the picture of the annual report image as it was too large
